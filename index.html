            <p>To start off our business, Lexicanna, would like to help you through Oregon’s Recreational Marijuana
                Licensing
                process. While helping you, we hope to increase our own knowledge of how we can further help small
                marijuana
                businesses in our community.
            </p>

                Our long term goal is to use our business writing and information technology skills to develop
                technological
                products for legal marijuana industry. Like you we are learning about Oregon’s local and state
                requirements for
                licensure as they evolve. We would like to stay abreast of these rules and regulations, so that we
                can help small
                business people like you can be compliant and have a good chance at licensure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beginning in January we will be offering A License for Mary Jane workshops around the Rogue Valley.
                In these
                workshops we will present to you strategies which can assist you to get your Oregon Recreational
                Marijuana license.
                We also expect to learn from you. Your concerns, experiences, and needs concerning your adventure of
                becoming a
                legal marijuana business are important to us. The more we know about this journey to legalization,
                the better we
                will be able to help out you and others.
            </p>
