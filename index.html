            <p>Lexicanna would like to help you through Oregon’s Recreational Marijuana
                Licensing
                process. While helping you, we hope to increase our own knowledge of how we can further help small
                marijuana
                businesses in our community.
            </p>

            <p>Our long term goal is to use our business writing and information technology skills to develop products
    for the legal marijuana industry. Like you, we are learning about Oregon’s state and local requirements for licensure as
    they evolve. We will stay abreast of these rules and regulations, so that we can help small business people
    like you can be compliant and have a good chance at licensure. </p>

            <p>
                Beginning in January we will be offering <a href="workshops.html">A License for Mary Jane</a> workshops around the Rogue Valley.
                In these
                workshops we will present strategies which can assist you to get your Oregon Recreational
                Marijuana license.
                We also expect to learn from you. Your concerns, experiences, and needs concerning your adventure of
                becoming a
                legal marijuana business are important to us. The more we know about this journey to legalization,
                the better we
                will be able to help you and others.
            </p>
