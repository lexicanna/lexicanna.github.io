            <p>Lexicanna, like many marijuana businesses, is a start-up family business. The idea of the business came
                to partners
                Jane Anderson and Monty Zukowski after looking into the possibility of having someone legally growing
                marijuana on
                their property. Jane, Monty, and their daughter have lived in the Applegate over 20 years. When they
                bought their
                homestead it was off-the-grid, powered by solar panels, and with a large organic garden. Since then they
                have worked
                to live on our property sustainably, while also creating back-up systems to make their lives easier.
            </p>

            <p>Monty and Jane have been members of various community groups over the last 20 years, including the
                Siskiyou Tilth,
                Headwaters Environmental Organization, the Mt. Mazama Mushroom Club, and the Rogue Yacht Club. They
                homeschooled
                their daughter through the 8th grade with the help of Ashland’s Willow Wind Community Learning Center.
            </p>

            <p>When Monty was hired to work for Trilobyte, a short-lived computer game company, they moved to the Rogue
                Valley.
                Since then Monty has worked for Harry and David, the Stadium of the Future, Donors Choose, and for the
                last 10
                years (remotely) for Temboo, a New York based information technology company. Monty won the Bruce
                Sterling Data
                Disintegration Award with his computer art piece “Embrace the Decay.”
            </p>

            <p>Jane Anderson brings to this business her teaching and writing skills. Jane began teaching while still a
                student at
                the University of Hawaii. Eventually she was hired to teach both composition and business writing at the
                University
                and well as creative writing in the public schools. Jane taught overseas in Italy and Sri Lanka before
                returning to
                the United State to get her doctorate in Instructional Design from Ohio State. Jane made all the pottery
                shown on this site. You can see more of her work at <a href="http://www.washdish.com/pottery">Woodland Sun Pottery</a>
            </p>

            <p>Both Monty and Jane would like to create a business to serve our community's local needs.
